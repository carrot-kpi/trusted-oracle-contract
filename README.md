# Carrot trusted oracle contracts

A set of smart contracts powering trusted oracles on Carrot. Trusted oracles are
generic oracles that accept finalization from a specific external account and
trust their final answer.

This can be used as a base building block to build more customizable or feature
rich oracle templates.
